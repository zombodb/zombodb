# ZomboDB Source Installation Instructions

> Note: If you're a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/eeeebbbbrrrr), you might want to also read the [binary installation](/administration/binary-installation.html) documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Postgres 10.x, 11.x, 12.x, or 13.x installed. If you have installed it from a package manager, ensure that you have also included the relevant "`-server`" package.
- A toolchain capable of building Postgres:

    For Ubuntu, this is enough:

    ```
    apt install bison flex zlib1g zlib1g-dev \
        pkg-config make libssl-dev libreadline-dev
    ```

- The Rust toolchain
- `cargo install cargo-pgx`
- A 64bit Intel Architecture

## Building from sources

First off, and you'll only need to do this once, you need to initialize `cargo-pgx`, and
you'll want to tell it the path to the version of Postgres on your computer.

If that version of Postgres is pg12, and assuming its `pg_config` tool is on your `$PATH`, 
this will likely work:

```shell script
$ cargo pgx init --pg12=`which pg_config`
```

Next, clone this repo, change into the checkout directory and simply run:

```shell script
$ cargo pgx install --release
```

This will compile ZomboDB **and** install it into the Postgres installation described by `pg_config`.  The user that
runs the above command will need write permissions to the Postgres `$PG_INSTALL_PATH/lib/postgresql/` and `$PG_INSTALL_PATH/share/postgresql/extension/` directories.

## Updating ZomboDB to a new version

Updating ZomboDB from sources will simply require a `git pull`, another `make clean install` and running  `ALTER EXTENSION zombodb UPDATE;` in all databases that use the ZomboDB extension.


## Building binary artifacts with Docker

If you have a proper Docker installation you can simply run:

```shell script
$ cd docker-build-system
$ cargo run <branch-name> [<docker-image-name> <pg major version>]
```

Likely for the `<branch-name>` argument you'll want to specify `master`, unless perhaps you're working on a custom branch.

If you're only targeting one Linux distro and Postgres version, you'll want to specify all three arguments.

This process will take a long time (potentially hours depending on your download speeds), but it will build ZomboDB for all supported Linux distro and Postgres version permutations.

You can set an environment variable named `CPUS` to limit the number of CPUs the build process will use, but the default is however many your computer has.

The final binary artifacts will be placed in the `./target/zdb-build/artifacts/` directory.

No logs are created, but in the event of Docker/compilation errors, the entire output of the
thing that failed is printed to stdout.

Once binary artifacts are build, follow the instructions in [binary installation](/administration/binary-installation.html) to install the proper artifact for your environment.
