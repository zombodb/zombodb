# [![ZomboDB](logo.png)](http://www.zombodb.com/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zombodb/zombodb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zombodb/zombodb/branches)

ZomboDB is a Postgres extension that enables efficient full-text searching via the use of indexes  
backed by Elasticsearch.  In order to achieve this, ZomboDB implements Postgres' [Access Method API](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/indexam.html).

In practical terms, a ZomboDB index appears to Postgres as no different than a standard btree index.  As such, standard SQL commands are fully supported, including `SELECT`, `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ABORT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `COPY`, and `VACUUM`.

Because ZomboDB implements Postgres' Access Method API, ZomboDB indexes are MVCC-safe, even as concurrent sessions mutate underlying tables.  Following Postgres' MVCC rules means that every transaction sees, at all times, a view of the backing Elasticsearch index that is always consistent with the current transaction's snapshot.

Behind the scenes, ZomboDB indexes communicate with Elasticsearch via HTTP and are automatically synchronized, in a high-performance manner, as data changes.

Index management happens using standard Postgres SQL commands such as `CREATE INDEX`, `REINDEX`, and `ALTER INDEX`.  Searching uses standard SQL `SELECT` statements with a custom operator that exposes a [full-text query language](SYNTAX.md) supporting most of Elasticsearch's query constructs.

Elasticsearch-calculated aggregations are also provided through custom functions.

## Features

- transaction-safe, MVCC-correct full text queries
- managed & queried via standard Postgres SQL
- works with tables of any structure
- automatically creates Elasticsearch Mappings supporting most datatypes, including arrays
   - supports full set of Elasticsearch [language analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/analysis-lang-analyzer.html)
   - support for [custom analyzer chains](TYPE-MAPPING.md)
   - custom [per-field mappings](TYPE-MAPPING.md)
   - json/jsonb columns as nested objects for flexible schemaless sub-documents
- works with all Postgres query plans, including [sequential scans](SEQUENTIAL-SCAN-SUPPORT.md) 
- use whatever method you currently use for talking to Postgres (JDBC, DBI, libpq, etc)
- extremely fast indexing
- [per-row scoring](SQL-API.md#function-zdb_scoretable_name-regclass-ctid-tid-returns-float4) with term/phrase boosting
- [record count estimation](SQL-API.md#function-zdb_estimate_counttable_name-regclass-query-text-returns-bigint)
- custom full-text query language supporting nearly all of Elasticsearch's search features, such as
  - boolean operations
  - proximity (in and out of order)
  - phrases, wildcards, fuzzy terms/phrases
  - regular expressions, inline scripts
  - range queries
  - "more like this"
  - any Elasticsearch query construct through direct JSON
- [query expansion](SYNTAX.md#query-expansion) and [index linking](INDEX-OPTIONS.md)
- [support](SIREn-SUPPORT.md) for [SIREn](http://siren.solutions/relational-joins-for-elasticsearch-the-siren-join-plugin/) to resolve index links
- [search multiple tables at once](SQL-API.md#function-zdb_multi_searchtable_names-regclass-user_identifiers-text-field_names-query-text-returns-setof-zdb_multi_search_response)
- [high-performance hit highlighting](SQL-API.md#function-zdb_highlighttable_name-regclass-es_query-text-where_clause-text-returns-set-of-zdb_highlight_response)
- limit/offset/sorting of fulltext queries by Elasticsearch
- support for common Elasticsearch aggregations, including ability to nest
- access to all of Elasticsearch's aggregations via direct JSON
- extensive test suite

Not to suggest that these things are impossible, but there's a small set of non-features too:

- ZomboDB indexes are not WAL-logged by Postgres.  As such, ZomboDB indexes are not recoverable in the event of a Postgres server crash and will require a `REINDEX`
- interoperability with various Postgres replication schemes is unknown
- Postgres [HOT](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/heap/README.HOT) update chains are not supported (necessitates a `VACUUM FULL` if a HOT-updated row is found)

## What you need

Product       | Version 
---           | ---      
Postgres      | 9.3, 9.4, 9.5
Elasticsearch | 1.7.1+ (not 2.0)

For information about how to develop/build ZomboDB, see the [Development Guide](DEVELOPER.md).

## How to Use It

Usage is really quite simple.  Note that this is just a brief overview.  See the various documentation files for more detailed information.

Install the extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION zombodb;
```

Create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL8 NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name text NOT NULL,
    keywords varchar(64)[],
    short_summary phrase,
    long_description fulltext, 
    price bigint,
    inventory_count integer,
    discontinued boolean default false,
    availability_date date
);
-- insert some data
```

Index it:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_zdb_products 
          ON products 
       USING zombodb(zdb('products', products.ctid), zdb(products))
        WITH (url='http://localhost:9200/', shards=5, replicas=1);
```

Query it:

```sql
SELECT * 
  FROM products 
 WHERE zdb('products', ctid) ==> 'keywords:(sports,box) or long_description:(wooden w/5 away) and price < 100000';
```

## History

The name is an homage to [zombo.com](http://zombo.com/) and its long history of continuous self-affirmation. 

Development began in 2013 by [Technology Concepts & Design, Inc](http://www.tcdi.com) as a closed-source effort to provide transaction safe full-text searching on top of Postgres tables.  While Postgres' "tsearch" features are useful, they're not necessarily adequate for 200 column-wide tables with 100M rows, each containing large text content.

Initially designed on-top of Postgres' Foreign Data Wrapper API, ZomboDB quickly evolved into an index type (Access Method) so that queries are MVCC-safe and standard SQL can be used to query and manage indexes.

Elasticsearch was chosen as the backing search index because of its horizontal scaling abilities, performance, and general ease of use.

ZomboDB was open-sourced in July 2015 and has been used in numerous production systems of various sizes and complexity.
