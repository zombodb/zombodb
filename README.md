# ðŸš¨ Note ðŸš¨

This is ZomboDB 3000.0.0-**beta1**.  This represents a year-long rewrite of ZomboDB to Rust.

It is expected that the alpha/beta phase will continue through January 2021.  That said, please
get started with it today.  Report Issues, provide feedback, and also [sponsors our work](https://github.com/sponsors/eeeebbbbrrrr)!


## Readme
ZomboDB brings powerful text-search and analytics features to Postgres by using Elasticsearch as an index type.  Its comprehensive query language and SQL functions enable new and creative ways to query your relational data.

From a technical perspective, ZomboDB is a 100% native Postgres extension that implements Postgres' Index Access Method API.  As a native Postgres index type, ZomboDB allows you to `CREATE INDEX ... USING zombodb` on your existing Postgres tables.  At that point, ZomboDB takes over and fully manages the remote Elasticsearch index and guarantees transactionally-correct text-search query results.

ZomboDB is fully compatible with all of Postgres' query plan types and most SQL commands such as `CREATE INDEX`, `COPY`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `REINDEX`, `(auto)VACUUM`, etc.

It doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re using an Elasticsearch cloud provider or managing your own cluster -- ZomboDB communicates with Elasticsearch via its RESTful APIs so youâ€™re covered either way.

ZomboDB allows you to use the power and scalability of Elasticsearch directly from Postgres.  You donâ€™t have to manage transactions between Postgres and Elasticsearch, asynchronous indexing pipelines, complex reindexing processes, or multiple data-access code paths -- ZomboDB does it all for you.

## Features

 - MVCC-correct text-search and aggregation results
 - Managed and queried via standard SQL
 - Works with current Elasticsearch releases (no plugins required)
 - Query using
    - Elasticsearch's [Query String Syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax) via `dsl.query_string()`
    - ZQL -- [ZomboDB's custom query language](ZQL.md)
    - Raw Elasticsearch QueryDSL JSON
    - ZomboDB's type-safe [query builder SQL syntax](QUERY-DSL.md)
    - Any combination of the above, even in combination with standard SQL
 - [Scoring and Highlighting Support](SCORING-HIGHLIGHTING.md)
 - [Support for all Elasticsearch aggregations](AGGREGATIONS.md)
 - Automatic Elasticsearch Mapping Generation
    - Ability to map custom domains
    - Per-field custom mappings
    - `json/jsonb` automatically mapped as dynamic nested objects
    - Supports full set of [Elasticsearch language analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-lang-analyzer.html)
    - Supports [Elasticsearch's Similarity Module](TYPE-MAPPING.md#similarity-module-support) 
 - Hot-Standby compatible
 - Support for indexing & searching [PostGIS `geometry` and `geography` types](POSTGIS-SUPPORT.md)


## Current Limitations

 - Only one ZomboDB index per table
 - ZomboDB indexes with predicates (ie, [partial indexes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/indexes-partial.html)) are not supported
 - `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is not supported
 - Partitioned Tables are not properly supported.  This will be resolved in a near-future version (Issue #630)

These limitations may be addressed in future versions of ZomboDB.

## Quick Overview

Note that this is just a quick overview.  Please read the [getting started tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) for more details.

Create the extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION zombodb;
```

Create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL8 NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name text NOT NULL,
    keywords varchar(64)[],
    short_summary text,
    long_description zdb.fulltext, 
    price bigint,
    inventory_count integer,
    discontinued boolean default false,
    availability_date date
);

-- insert some data
```

Create a ZomboDB index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idxproducts 
          ON products 
       USING zombodb ((products.*)) 
        WITH (url='localhost:9200/');
```

Query it:

```sql
SELECT * 
  FROM products 
 WHERE products ==> '(keywords:(sports OR box) OR long_description:"wooden away"~5) AND price:[1000 TO 20000]';
```

- [Support for Elasticsearch 1.7](https://github.com/zombodb/zombodb/tree/master-es1.7) (unsupported)

Commercial support for all versions of ZomboDB is available by [contacting ZomboDB, LLC](https://www.zombodb.com/services/).


 
## History

The name is an homage to zombo.com and its long history of continuous self-affirmation.

Historically, ZomboDB began in 2013 by Technology Concepts & Design, Inc as a closed-source effort to provide transaction safe text-search on top of Postgres tables. While Postgres' "tsearch" features are useful, they're not necessarily adequate for 200 column-wide tables with 100M rows, each containing large text content.

Initially designed on-top of Postgres' Foreign Data Wrapper API, ZomboDB quickly evolved into an index type so that queries are MVCC-safe and standard SQL can be used to query and manage indices.

Elasticsearch was chosen as the backing search index because of its horizontal scaling abilities, performance, and general ease of use.

ZomboDB was open-sourced in July 2015 and has since been used in numerous production systems of various sizes and complexity.
